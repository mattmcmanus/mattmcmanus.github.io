For many years I've enjoyed reading Charles Spurgeon's Morning and Evening. A couple weeks ago I was reminded of this work's value (as well as realizing it was in the public domain) and decided I would make a website for it. I know there are many sites out there that offer it up to read, but to be honest, they all bothered me. I wanted to treat this amazing work with a great deal of respect and create the best looking site I could muster. So I set out to make something that was elegant, easy to read and most importantly, distraction free.

It's still a work in progress, so there are some kinks to work out still. I'm building it to work well on mobile devices as well and that is were it needs to most polish. I think that it's useful now in its current state so I'm setting it loose. I desperately hope that it will prove useful for people.

Please let me know what you think!
