I was sitting at home friday night feeling pretty beat up. I had spent the entire week trying to find a bug in a large peice of code that I help support at [P'unk Ave](http://punkave.com) and made no progress. I was aching to write some code that worked and I was proud of. I then pulled out my phone to check twitter and saw this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Going to <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23execute">#execute</a> my <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23A11Y">#A11Y</a> project idea tonight and (hopefully) launch it tomorrow. If you're interested in contributing, ping me.</p>&mdash; Dave Rupert (@davatron5000) <a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000/status/289509622866395136" data-datetime="2013-01-10T23:10:47+00:00">January 10, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Why not? I was curious and eager to write some code and refresh my <abbr title="Accessibility">A11Y</abbr> skills. Three days, 33 issues and 18 pull requests and 9 contributors later, there is **[simpleA11Y.com](http://simplea11y.com/)**.

I can honesly say that this is one of most inspiring collaborations I've ever worked on. Not simply because of the topic or the fact that I was able to work with people who's work I've long admired. It was the *process* of how this site was made and how easy [github](http://github.com) made it. It was incredible to see pull requests coming in for simple bug fixes and new article ideas, discussions on different features and plans for the content. It was a flurry of excited people doing a lot of great work and I'm thankful to have been able to witness it happen and play a small part.

Makre sure to checkout [Dave's post on why he decided to make this](http://daverupert.com/2013/01/simple-accessibility/).

Now back to that bug...
