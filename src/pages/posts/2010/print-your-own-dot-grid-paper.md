When I came across [Behance's Action Method paper products](http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/#cat1) I loved them. They have a beautiful dot grid that I found much nicer than the standard squared rule of my [moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/classic/hard_black_cover/squared_notebook__large.php). The problem with the Action Method papers is that it's not exactly what I need. I don't need the action steps and  I wanted loose papers that I could easily throw on a wall or spread out on a desk.

After some searching around for something I decided I'd make one myself. Why not? It would be nice to have some standard template that I could just print out when I needed it. I came across a [quarter inch dot grid templates for transparencies](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072532947/student_view0/grid_and_dot_paper.html)  that I used as a base. I played with the dot colors, extended the grid and wala!
