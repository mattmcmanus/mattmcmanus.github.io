Lately, I've been trying to make sense of our toxic political climate. I've been wondering what is at the root of the constant misunderstandings in our political conversations. In the end, I realized I needed to ask myself a few simple questions and they apply to much more than just politics:

> What preoccupations, stubborn expectations or ignorant assumptions are blinding me to the reality that is before me?

> Am I ok with that?

It's been humbling. It makes me sad to think that I've thought less of someone because of a reality that I constructed in my head; That I've missed out on something truly amazing because I've failed to let myself see the truth.
