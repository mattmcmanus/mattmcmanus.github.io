When I was doing a lot of Drupal work, Development Seed was always a source of inspiration. Any module worth using was usually made or maintained by them. Over the last year and a half I've switch most of my development to Node.js and started making sites with just static HTML using generators such as [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [Docpad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad). To my surprise, so has development seed. They've written up a great post discussing why they moved away from the complexities of modern CMSs and some of the lessons they've learned along the way.
