ALA posted their "favorite articles from 355 issues of A List Apart" as an summer reading list. This site is part of my DNA as a web developer and has been responsible for much of my growth over the years, especially early on. If you have any interest in making the web at all, then read these articles. They're simply amazing.

They've also posted all the articles as a [Readlist](http://readlists.com/cc0d2783/) so it's incredibly easy to send them all to your kindle. Neat!
