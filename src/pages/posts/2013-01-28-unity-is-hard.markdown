I am a person whose instinctual view of the world is black and white. You're either a good guy or a bad guy. You're either for this or against it. I work very hard to temper that instinct so that I don't miss the truth that often lies in the gray areas. There are, however, certain times and certain subjects where the clarity of a black and white view of the world is incredibly valuable. It can serve to keep you pointed in the right direction when emotional reactions threaten to pull you apart.

One topic that needs such clarity is unity. Unity is hard. Having a shared interest/ideology doesn't create it and it's not something that simply "grows organically." Unity is something that requires work and the type that hurts. There is no passive approach to it either; You are either working towards it or you are not. At it's most challenging, it requires you to act in a way that feels like a part of you is dying: To trust when your reaction is to distrust - To be silent when you feel compelled to speak - To speak out and defend someone even though you may disagree with them. All for the good of the group as a whole, *as well* as its individual members, even when doing so does not serve our own interests.

Why? Why is something that feels so insane worth it?  Because a community truly thrives when it is working towards something bigger than any of it's individual members. To work towards something greater than yourself, you need to stop thinking and acting only as an individual. We're not very good at that.
