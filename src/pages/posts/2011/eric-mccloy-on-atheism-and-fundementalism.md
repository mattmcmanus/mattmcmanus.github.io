> Fundamentalists and atheists both assume that increasing scientific knowledge decreases our need for God. This leads fundamentalists to reject science and atheists to reject god. The fatal flaw on both sides is the assumption that god is only the explanation for what we don't yet understand. But if God actually is creator, sustainer and lover of the universe and our souls, science becomes a revealer of the divine mind and knowledge strengthens our faith, rather than erodes it.
