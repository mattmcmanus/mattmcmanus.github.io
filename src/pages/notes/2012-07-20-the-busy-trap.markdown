The anti-busy train keeps on rolling. I love this article by Tim Kreider. It's a thought provoking and challenging look at what fuels our constant business.

> Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration â€” it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.
